TinyClassifier - a tiny machine learning library for scripting

* Overview

  Tinyclassifier is a fast an flexible machine learning library with
  following features:

 - Minimum dependencies to external libraries
 - Efficient and compact implementation with C++
 - Interfaces to ruby, perl, python, etc. via SWIG

* Algorithms

 - Averaged Perceptron for binary classification

   non-kernelized version and kernelized version
   (currently polynomial kernel only)

* Requirements

 - gcc 4.3 (possibly gcc 4.x)
 - swig 1.3.35 (possibly swig 1.3.x)

* Build & Install

** C++ library

  1. Type 'make' at the top directory of tinyclassifier.

  2. Copy 'lib/libtinyclassifier.so' and the header files in
  'include/' to an appropriate directory included in LD_LIBRARY_PATH /
  CPATH.

*** Recommended compile options

    For a multicore processor,

        CXXFLAGS="-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=1 -msse2 -ftree-vectorize -O3"

** SWIG bindings

   1. Type 'make -C swig' at the top directory of tinyclassifier.

   2. (for Ruby) Go to the directory 'swig/ruby' and type 'make
      install'.
      
      For some language bindings, you might have to manually install
      library files.
      # to be prepared

* Usage

  See the tests included in the package for the examples of usage.
  Tests are included at 'test', 'swig/ruby/test', etc.
